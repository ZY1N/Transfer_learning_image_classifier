# Transfer_learning_image_classifier
Followed tutorial to build a custom image classifier that you can train on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

### How to use: ###

Open up the .html file in the browser and give it access to your webcam.
To train:
  - To classify the first object put the object in the frame and click whatever class you want to assign it('A', 'B', or'C').
  - For best effect take photos with object all around the frame and in different positions.
  - Train the other 2 objects.
  - You're done! When you show a object to the webcam it'll predict which of the 3 classes it thinks it is.
